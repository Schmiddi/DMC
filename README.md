This repository cointains training  and test data as well as the R script used
for classification in two different data mining cups which took place from the 19/12/14 until the 19/01/15.

DMC1 contains 16 Attributes, 4000 training and 1000 test instances (comma seperated).  
DMC2 contains 38 Attributes, 4000 training and 1000 test instances (comma seperated).

In both you need to calculate the *score* which is calculated as follows:   
`score = tp + tn`
